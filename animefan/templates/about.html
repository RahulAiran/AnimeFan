                            information you submit in order to deliver a better experience on the service.<br>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use session cookies to make
                            it easier for you to navigate our site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. You can
                            remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.<br>If you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or
                            surveys, may be limited.<br>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. These are non-personal information which includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type,
                            internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyse trends, to administer the website,
                            to track users’ movements around the website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do link this automatically-collected data to personal information.<br><br>6. BEHAVIORAL TARGETING / RE-TARGETING<br>We
                            partner with a third-party ad network to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personal information about your
                            activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here.

                            of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We limit access to personal information
                            about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations
                            and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is secure, however, we
                            cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br><br>9. THIRD PARTY SITES<br>This Policy only applies to the Anime Fan website and services. We do not exercise control over the sites that our service links to. These other sites may
